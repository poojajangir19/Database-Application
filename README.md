# Database-Application
Created database diagrams, populated data into the database and retreived, queried, and analysed important data about a crime-reporting application to understand the crime-rate in a city. 
The data retrieved provides crucial information about:
1)	The rate at which a type of crime is reported in a city 
2)	The current status about the incidents reoprted
3)	Data about the safety alerts notifications being sent to a city's residents
From the data query results, one can deduce whether an area is safe or not and if its residents are exposed to high levels of crime.
To safeguard people's lives and property, the integration of this service for crime reporting and monitoring process 
is key as this will effectively bridge the communication gap between the police and the general public in fighting crime.
